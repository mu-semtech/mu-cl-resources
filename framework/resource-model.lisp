   TODO: Splitting this method into a 'base' which detects the last
   element, a portion which follows constraints for the resource
   paths, and a part which contains the ending constraint for the
   specified (or all) properties, would make this function easier to
   read.  Consumers would likely know which base case to call, hence
   the latter two could receive a wrapper as an entry-point if that
   makes things easier to read in the consumer.

   If the last component of the specification yields a resource,
   rather than a property, the search path will allow for all
   properties in that search path.

   Returns (values sparql-pattern target-variable last-slot slots) in
   which the property-path is the description above, target-variable
   is a sparql variable containing the last most specific match,
