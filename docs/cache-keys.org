Cache keys

Which cache keys are used, and what do they mean?

* Notes on the implementation
  This new implementation doesn't take into account that relationships may be defined bidirectionally.  The caching mechanism should cope with this in the future, but doesn't do so at this stage.  Such a thing can be bolted on top of the current approach, by introspecting the defined model and altering the cache primitives.  The current primitives should be sufficient.

* Why cache keys
  The cache keys ensure that the mu-cache can cache resources, and that the mu-cache can clear the resources when they are altered.  The meaning of each of the cache keys needs to be well-defined, and the combination of all keys needs to allow us to correctly reset the cache.

* Which cache keys
  An overview of each of the cache keys, and when you should use them.

  - { resource, id } :: Clear whenever this specific resource changes
  - { resource } :: Clear whenever a listing of this resource could have changed
  - { resource, id, relationship } :: Clear whenever the relationship
       for this specific resource gets updated. Note that including
       this likely means including { resource, id } of the target of
       the relationship also.

* What should happen on each call

** DONE list-call
   - { resource } :: for simple list calls

** DONE show-call
   - { resource, id } :: for the specific resource

** DONE show-relation-call
   - { resource, id, relationship } :: cache only invalidates when
        relationships are altered, or resources themselves.
   - { resource, relationship } :: used for clearing inverse
        relationships.  in this case we will not know which links to
        clear exactly.
   - { resource, id } :: for each returned resource

*** DONE What about pagination?
    Check if the type of resource shouldn't be paginated.  If it
    should be, then cache on { returnedResource }, otherwise cache on
    the specific returned resources.

** DONE create-call
   - { resource } :: b/c lists can be altered

*** TODO relationships
    When inverse relationships can be checked, this should also output
    the relationships.

** DONE update-call
   - { resource } :: for each touched class
   - { resource, id } :: for attributes
   - { resource, id, relationship } :: for altered relationships
   - { resource, relationship } :: for known inverse relationships

** DONE delete-call
   - { resource } :: b/c lists can be altered
   - { resource, id } :: for the deleted object
   - --{ resource, relationship }-- :: not needed, either our
        identifier is specified in the other direction, or we do not
        exist anymore.

** DONE patch-relation-call
   - { resource } :: may have an effect on listings (filters, for instance)
   - { resource, id, relationship } :: invalidate cached relationship
   - { resource, relationship } :: for known inverse relationships

** DONE add-relation-coll
   - { resource } :: see patch-relation-call
   - { resource, id, relationship } :: see patch-relation-call
   - { resource, relationship } :: see patch-relation-call

** DONE delete-relation-call
   - { resource } :: see patch-relation-call
   - { resource, id, relationship } ::  see patch-relation-call
   - { resource, relationship } :: see patch-relation-call

** DONE included resources
   Included resources can be specified by their relationship.  In
   unconstrained lists, we specify the connected resource, in
   constrained lists, we specify the resource itself.

*** constrained lists
    - { targetResource, id } :: Pick included destination elements
    - { resource, id, relationship } :: Pick the relationship of the
         item which has the inclusion.
    - { resource, relationship } :: Specify the relationship itself,
         for clearing known inverse relationships

*** unconstrained lists
    - { targetResource } :: If there's no specific set of items to
         start from, the whole targetResource can invalidate the
         cache.
