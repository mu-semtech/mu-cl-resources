# JSONAPI to SPARQL, and back

mu-cl-resources provides a [JSONAPI](http://jsonapi.org) compatible interface to the content specified in the configuration.  Most configuration occurs in the configuration/domain.json or configuration/domain.lisp file (your choice), an examples of which can be found in this repository.

Most configuration happens in the domain file.  See `configuration/domain.json` and `configuration/domain.lisp` for an introduction.  This file defines the glue between the JSON world and the RDF world.  When defining a model, be sure to have a good idea on what both worlds will look like.

The documentation offered here is not exhaustive.  This component handles a wide variety of use-cases and has support for esotheric features for experimentation, which may land in the core at a later time.  As such, some features which the component offers are not documented in this readme.

The domain.json format is still growing, some configuration parameters can only be set in the lisp variant.  You can combine both formats, see Tutorial: Combining domain.lisp and domain.json.

## Tutorials

### Add mu-cl-resources to a stack
Add the following snippet to the services block of your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
services:
  resource:
    image: semtech/mu-cl-resources:1.20.0
    links:
      - db:database
    volumes:
      - ./config/resources:/config
```

Next, copy the configuration files from the `examples/` folder in this repository inside the `./config/resources` folder of your project. You have to copy either the JSON configuration file `examples/domain.json` or the Lisp configuration files `examples/domain.lisp` and `examples/repository.lisp`.

Finally, add a new rule to the dispatcher configuration of your project in `./config/dispatcher/dispatcher.ex` to forward requests to `/themes` to the new resource service:
```yml
  get "/themes/*path", @any do
    forward conn, path, "http://resource/themes/"
  end
```

Start your stack running `docker-compose up -d`. Assuming the identifier is published on port 80, sending a request to http://localhost/themes should return an empty array coming from mu-cl-resources.

Since it is common for a mu.semte.ch project to contain mu-cl-resources, the default blueprint for a mu.semte.ch project, [mu-semtech/mu-project](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-project), contains mu-cl-resources.

### Introduction to a configuration through domain.lisp
This service is driven from the domain.lisp file which you should adapt to describe your domain.  In this section we briefly describe how everything is wired together, and how you can quickly get an API up and running.

mu-cl-resources is driven from the domain.lisp file.  This file describes the connection between the JSONAPI and the semantic model.  Secondly, there is the repository.lisp file, in which you can define new prefixes to shorten your domain description.  This repository contains an example of both files in the examples folder.

#### /configuration/domain.lisp

The domain.lisp contains resource definitions for each resource type in the application.  These resource definitions provide a three-way connection:

  - It names things to make connections within the domain.lisp file
  - It describes the properties as seen through the json api
  - It describes the semantic model used in order to implement the json api

Each resource definition is a combination of these three views.  Let us assume an example using [foaf](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/).  In our example, we will model a Person, having one or more online accounts.  This model can be vizualised using [WebVOWL](http://visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#).

Intermezzo: mu-cl-resources is mainly configured in lisp.  Lisp uses parens () for grouping content.  If a paren is followed by a word, that word tends to indicate the content of the group.  If there is no word, it tends to be a list.  Other characters, like the backtick (`) or the comma (,) are best copied from examples.

    (define-resource person ()
      :class (s-url "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-url "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name")))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/people/")
      :on-path "people")

A simple definition of a person uses the foaf vocabulary to write the person and the person name.

  - *Line 1* contains `define-resource person`, which indicates that we'll create a new endpoint which we will name `person` in this file.  It is most customary to use a singular name for this name.
  - *Line 2* specifies that the RDF class to which the person belongs in the triplestore is [foaf:Person](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person).
  - *Line 3* specifies a singular property of the person.  The JSONAPI will assume content of type `string` is stored in the json key `data.attributes.name` (because of `:name`).  This value is connected to our resource in the triplestore by the predicate [foaf:name](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name).  Note that this word may contain dashes, but not capitals (capitals are ignored).
  - *Line 4* indicates the URI to use in the triplestore when we create new resources of this type.  The supplied url is postfixed with a UUID.
  - *Line 5* specifies the endpoint on which we can list/create/update our resource.  In our case, requests to `/people` are mapped to this resource.

Assuming the foaf `prefix` is defined, we can make this example slightly easier to read.  Note the use of `s-prefix`.

    (define-resource person ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:Person")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:name")))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/people/")
      :on-path "people")

This code sample implements the same functionality as the example above, yet it is easier on the eyes.

You may have noticed the double opening parens on line 3, after the `:properties` keyword.  We can insert multiple properties if desired.  Ensuring we have the right amount of opening and closing parens, we can update our example to also contain the age of the person, expressed as a number.

    (define-resource person ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:Person")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:name"))
                    (:age :number ,(s-prefix "foaf:age")))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/people/")
      :on-path "people")

With this minor change, our person supports the name and age attributes.

Most resources link to other resources.  Let's first define a second resouce, an [OnlineAccount](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/OnlineAccount).

    (define-resource account ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:OnlineAccount")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:accountName")))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/accounts/")
      :on-path "accounts")

The definition of this `account` resource is very similar to that of the `person` resource.  How do we link a person to an account?  Assuming the person has many accounts, we link by using the `:has-many` keyword.

    (define-resource person ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:Person")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:name"))
                    (:age :number ,(s-prefix "foaf:age")))
      :has-many `((account :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:account")
                           :as "accounts"))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/people/")
      :on-path "people")

The statement on lines 5 and 6 specifies that a `person` may link to many resources of type `account`.  In the triplestore, the link can be found by following the [foaf:account](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/account) property, originating from the person's URI.  This relationship is exposed to the JSON API by using the relationship name "accounts".  Hence a GET to `/people/42/accounts` would yield the accounts of the person with UUID 42.

How about getting the person which links to this account.  There is only a single person connected to an account.  Hence we can use the `has-one` keyword to symbolize this.  In the semantic model of the triplestore, the relationship uses the [foaf:account](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/account) property going from the person to the account.  Finding the person for an account therefore means we have to follow the same relationship in the other direction.  We can add the option `:inverse t` to any relationship to make the semantic model follow the inverse arrow.  Here, the key in the json body will be `owner` rather than person.

    (define-resource account ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:OnlineAccount")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:accountName")))
      :has-one `((person :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:account")
                         :inverse t
                         :as "owner"))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/accounts/")
      :on-path "accounts")

The complete setup of our user and account looks as follows:

    (define-resource person ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:Person")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:name"))
                    (:age :number ,(s-prefix "foaf:age")))
      :has-many `((account :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:account")
                           :as "accounts"))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/people/")
      :on-path "people")

    (define-resource account ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:OnlineAccount")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:accountName")))
      :has-one `((person :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:account")
                         :inverse t
                         :as "owner"))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/accounts/")
      :on-path "accounts")

#### /configuration/repositories.lisp

The previous example used the foaf prefix in order to denote classes and properties.  The `/configuration/repositories.lisp` allows you to specify your own prefixes to use in your definitions.  A good source for commonly used abbreviations is [prefix.cc](https://prefix.cc).

    (add-prefix "foaf" "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/")

#### Resulting API
We intend to support the full spec of [JSONAPI](http://jsonapi.org).  Support for this API comes out of the box with frameworks such as [ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data).  Most of what you read there will work, errors being a notable exception.  Here, we list some common calls which you could execute using the resources specified above.

  - `# GET /people`
  - `# GET /people/0b29a57a-d324-4302-9c92-61958e4cf250/accounts`
  - `# GET /people?filter=John`
  - `# GET /people?filter[age]=42`
  - `# GET /people?include=accounts`
  - `# GET /people?filter[:exact:name]=John%20Doe`
  - `# GET /people?sort=age`
  - `# GET /accounts?sort=-person.age`

  - `# POST /people/0b29a57a-d324-4302-9c92-61958e4cf250`
  - `# PATCH /people/0b29a57a-d324-4302-9c92-61958e4cf250`
  - `# PATCH /people/0b29a57a-d324-4302-9c92-61958e4cf250/relationships/accounts`
  - `# DELETE /people/0b29a57a-d324-4302-9c92-61958e4cf250/relationships/accounts`
  - `# DELETE /people/0b29a57a-d324-4302-9c92-61958e4cf250`

More information on each of these calls can be found throughout this document.

#### More configuration options

The complete mu-cl-resources instance, a specific resource, as well as a property can have options set to override the default behaviour.

  - *mu-cl-resources options:* These are specified by the `defparameter` expression as a top-level form in the domain.lisp file.
  - *resource specific options:* The keyword `:features` at the same level as the `:class` may specify options which alter the behaviour of the specific resource.
  - *property options:* Symbols following the definition of a single property may give mu-cl-resources extra information on how the property will be used.

### Introduction to a configuration through domain.json
mu-cl-resources is driven from the domain.json file.  This file describes the connection between the JSONAPI and the semantic model.   In this section we briefly describe how everything is wired together, and how you can quickly get an API up and running. This repository contains an example file in the examples folder.


#### /configuration/domain.json
The domain.json contains resource definitions for each resource type in the application.  These resource definitions provide a three-way connection:

  - It names things to make connections within the domain.json file
  - It describes the properties as seen through the json api
  - It describes the semantic model used in order to implement the json api

Each resource definition is a combination of these three views.  Let us assume an example using [foaf](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/).  In our example, we will model a Person, having one or more online accounts.  This model can be vizualised using [WebVOWL](http://visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#).

```javascript
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "resources": {
    "people": {
      "name": "person",
      "class": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name"
        }
      },
      "new-resource-base": "https://my-application.com/people/"
    }
  }
}
```

A simple definition of a person uses the foaf vocabulary to write the person and the person name.

  - *Line 2* specifies the endpoint on which we can list/create/update our resource.  In our case, requests to `/people` are mapped to this resource.
  - *Line 3* contains the name `person` we will use to reference the resource in this file.  It is most customary to use a singular name for this name.
  - *Line 4* specifies that the RDF class to which the person belongs in the triplestore is [foaf:Person](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person).
  - *Line 5-10* specifies an attribute of the person.  The JSONAPI will assume content of type `string` is stored in the json key `data.attributes.name` (because of `name` as attribute key).  This value is connected to our resource in the triplestore by the predicate [foaf:name](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name).  Note that the attribute key may contain dashes, but not capitals (capitals are ignored).
  - *Line 11* indicates the URI to use in the triplestore when we create new resources of this type.  The supplied url is postfixed with a UUID.

Assuming the `foaf` prefix is defined, we can make this example slightly easier to read.

```javascript
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "prefixes": {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
  },
  "resources": {
    "people": {
      "name": "person",
      "class": "foaf:Person",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "foaf:name"
        }
      },
      "new-resource-base": "https://my-application.com/people/"
    }
  }
}
```

This code sample implements the same functionality as the example above, yet it is easier on the eyes.

We can insert multiple attributes if desired. We can update our example to also contain the age of the person, expressed as a number.

```javascript
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "prefixes": {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
  },
  "resources": {
    "people": {
      "name": "person",
      "class": "foaf:Person",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "foaf:name"
        },
        "age": {
          "type": "number",
          "predicate": "foaf:age"
        }
      },
      "new-resource-base": "https://my-application.com/people/"
    }
  }
}
```

With this minor change, our person supports the name and age attributes.

Most resources link to other resources.  Let's first define a second resouce, an [OnlineAccount](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/OnlineAccount).

```javascript
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "prefixes": {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
  },
  "resources": {
    "people": { ... },
    "accounts": {
      "name": "account",
      "class": "foaf:OnlineAccount",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "foaf:accountName"
        }
      },
      "new-resource-base": "https://my-application.com/accounts/"
    }
  }
}
```

The definition of this `account` resource is very similar to that of the `person` resource.  How do we link a person to an account?  Assuming the person has many accounts, we link by defining a `relationships` block on the `person` resource.


```javascript
{
  ...
  "resources": {
    "people": {
      "name": "person",
      "class": "foaf:Person",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "foaf:name"
        },
        "age": {
          "type": "number",
          "predicate": "foaf:age"
        }
      },
      "relationships": {
        "accounts": {
          "predicate": "foaf:account",
          "target": "account",
          "cardinality": "many"
        }
      },
      "new-resource-base": "https://my-application.com/people/"
    },
    "accounts": {
      "name": "account",
      "class": "foaf:OnlineAccount",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "foaf:accountName"
        }
      },
      "new-resource-base": "https://my-application.com/accounts/"
    }
  }
}
```

The `relationships` object specifies that a `person` may link to many resources of target type `account`.  In the triplestore, the link can be found by following the [foaf:account](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/account) predicate, originating from the person's URI.  This relationship is exposed to the JSON API by using the relationship name "accounts".  Hence a GET to `/people/42/accounts` would yield the accounts of the person with UUID 42.

How about getting the person which links to this account.  There is only a single person connected to an account.  Hence we can specify a relationship with cardinality `one` on the `account` resource.  In the semantic model of the triplestore, the relationship uses the [foaf:account](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/account) property going from the person to the account.  Finding the person for an account therefore means we have to follow the same relationship in the other direction.  We can add the property `"inverse": true` to any relationship to make the semantic model follow the inverse arrow.  Here, the key in the json body will be `owner` rather than person.

```javascript
{
  ...
  "resources": {
    "people": { ... },
    "accounts": {
      "name": "account",
      "class": "foaf:OnlineAccount",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "foaf:accountName"
        }
      },
      "relationships": {
        "owner": {
          "predicate": "foaf:account",
          "target": "person",
          "cardinality": "one",
          "inverse": true
        }
      },
      "new-resource-base": "https://my-application.com/accounts/"
    }
  }
}
```


The complete setup of our user and account looks as follows:

```javascript
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "prefixes": {
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
  },
  "resources": {
    "people": {
      "name": "person",
      "class": "foaf:Person",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "foaf:name"
        },
        "age": {
          "type": "number",
          "predicate": "foaf:age"
        }
      },
      "relationships": {
        "accounts": {
          "predicate": "foaf:account",
          "target": "account",
          "cardinality": "many"
        }
      },
      "new-resource-base": "https://my-application.com/people/"
    },
    "accounts": {
      "name": "account",
      "class": "foaf:OnlineAccount",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "foaf:accountName"
        }
      },
      "relationships": {
        "owner": {
          "predicate": "foaf:account",
          "target": "person",
          "cardinality": "one",
          "inverse": true
        }
      },
      "new-resource-base": "https://my-application.com/accounts/"
    }
  }
}
```

#### More configuration options
Configuration of the complete mu-cl-resource instance can only be done using a configuration file in Lisp. See Tutorial: Configuring settings using a domain.json file.

### Combining domain.lisp and domain.json
For larger applications with a broad domain, defining all resources in one domain file may become clumsy and confusing. Mu-cl-resources supports spreading your domain definitions across multiple files. The root domain files must be in Lisp format, but the included files may be in Lisp or JSON format.

To include additional files in your domain configuration, add `read-domain-file` statements on top of the `domain.lisp` file.

```lisp
(in-package :mu-cl-resources)

(read-domain-file "users.json")
(read-domain-file "publications.lisp")
```

Restart the service. The additional configuration files will be picked up by mu-cl-resources.

### Configuring settings using a domain.json file
Most settings can only be configured in Lisp format. This tutorial describes how to configure the settings if you defined your resources using a `domain.json` file.

First create a `domain.lisp` file next to the existing `domain.json` file.

Next, add the following contents to the `domain.lisp` file:
```
(in-package :mu-cl-resources)

(read-domain-file "domain.json")
```

Add your settings in `domain.lisp`.

Restart the service. The newly configured settings will be picked up by mu-cl-resources.

## Reference
### Defining resources in Lisp
As the integration with the frontend data-store is handled automatically, most of your time with mu-cl-resources will be spent configuring resources.  This overview provides a non-exhaustive list of the most common features of mu-cl-resources.

Each defined resource is specified by the `define-resource` construction.  An example could look like this:

    (define-resource person ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:Person")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:name")
                           :required)
                    (:age :number ,(s-url "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age")))
      :has-one `((location :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:based_near")
                           :as "location"))
      :has-many `((account :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:account")
                           :as "accounts")
                  (document :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:publications")
                            :as "publications"))
      :features '(include-uri)
      :resource-base (s-url "https://my-application.com/people/")
      :on-path "people")

We will use this example to explain how various features in mu-cl-resources work.

#### Overview of keys

Each call to `define-resource` starts out with the name of the resource (used when referring to the resource internally), a set of empty parens (for future use), and a set of key-value pairs.  This section gives a brief overview of the valid keys, and what their use is.

  - *`:class`* Sets the RDF Class to which instances should belong.  Use `s-url` when setting the full URL.
  - *`:properties`* Describes the properties (currently named attributes in the json response) of the resource.
  - *`:has-one`* Describes relationships of which at most one is expected to exist.
  - *`:has-many`* Describes relationships of which zero or more are expected to exist.
  - *`:features`* Optional features to be used in this resource.  Our example indicates the URI should be returned as an attribute.
  - *`:resource-base`* An `s-url` containing the prefix for the URI used when creating new resources.
  - *`:on-path`* The path on which the resource is supplied, this corresponds to the `type` property in the JSON body.  JSONAPI advises to use the plural form here.

#### Simple properties

The properties section in the mu-cl-resources configuration corresponds to the attributes in the JSON payload.  This section describes how to set properties.

The properties section in our example looks like:

      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:name")
                           :required)
                    (:age :number ,(s-url "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age")))

All properties are contained in a backtick (`) quoted list (note that this is *not* a regular quote (').  Each property description is itself contained in a list.  The list contains three ordered elements by default:

  1. *key name* First option is the key name (ie: `:name`).  It is downcased and used as the JSON key of the attribute.
  2. *type* Second option is the type of the attribute.  This ensures we correctly translate the attribute from JSON to SPARQL and vice-versa.  Use `,(s-url "...")` for full URLs or `,(s-prefix "...")` for shorthand names.
  3. *rdf property* Third option is the RDF property of the attribute.  This is the URL used on the arrow of the RDF model in the triplestore.
  4. *options* Any other keys following the three elements above are options to describe something extra about the resources.  The format of these may change over time.

A wide set of types is supported.  Extensions are necessary in order to implement new types:

  - *string* A regular string
  - *number* A number. Can be [decimals](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#decimal) or [floats](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#float). For read-only operations more types ([integers](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#integer)) are supported.
  - *integer* An [integer](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#integer), being a non-bounded whole number
  - *float* A [float](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#float), being a floating point number
  - *boolean* A boolean, true or false
  - *date* A date as understood by your triplestore
  - *datetime* A date and time combination, as understood by your triplestore
  - *time* A time without a date, as understood by your triplestore
  - *url* A URL to another resource
  - *uri-set* An array of URIs
  - *string-set* An array of strings
  - *language-string* A string which has a language connected to it (may contain multiple languages)
  - *language-string-set* An array of strings which have a language connected to it (may contain multiple languages per answer)
  - *g-year* Experimental: A specific representation of a year
  - *geometry* Experimental: A geometry-string in a format your triplestore understands

#### Relationships

Relationships are split into single value `:has-one` and multiple value `:has-many` relationships.  In both cases, having a value is optional.

      :has-one `((location :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:based_near")
                           :as "location"))
      :has-many `((account :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:account")
                           :as "accounts")
                  (document :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:publications")
                            :as "publications"))

Both `:has-one` and `:has-many` allow to specify more than one relationship.  The outermost parens group all relationships.  We use the backtick (`) rather than quote (') in order to denote the list of properties.

The format of a single value consists of the internal name of the resource to be linked to, followed by keyword properties describing the relationship.

  - *`:via`* Contains the URI of the RDF property by which the related objects can be found.
  - *`:as`* Contains the attribute in the JSON API.
  - *`:inverse`* Optional, when set to `t` it inverses the direction of the relationship supplied in `:via`.

#### Inheritance

Superclasses may be specified as a list after the resource name.  If a person is both an animal as well as an agent, we would write it as such:

    (define-resource person (animal agent)
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:Person")
      ...)

    (define-resource animal () ...)
    (define-resource agent ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:Agent")
      ...)

A definition of this kind includes instances of type `foaf:Person` when listing animals and when listing agents.  Any attributes or relationships set on `animal` or `agent` will be available on `person`.

Used types may change over time as the SPARQL endpoint evolves.  The following is subject to change.  Creating a new person will currently store both the type `foaf:Person` as well as `foaf:Agent`.  When using `agent` in a relationship, anything that has the type `foaf:Agent` or `foaf:Person` is accepted.  The json-api response will yield the most specific type in the listing (when the `foaf:Person` type is found, a `person` will be added to the listing).

### Defining resources in JSON
As the integration with the frontend data-store is handled automatically, most of your time with mu-cl-resources will be spent configuring resources. This overview provides a non-exhaustive list of the most common features of mu-cl-resources in JSON format.

The base structure of the JSON configuration file looks like this:
```javascript
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "prefixes": {
    // prefix definitions
  },
  "resources": {
    // resource definitions
  }
}
```

The following keys are valid at the root level of the JSON configuration:
* version: currently there is only one version supported: v0.1
* prefixes: a map of RDF prefixes to a namespace URI
* resources: a map of API paths to resource definitions. An entry is defined for each resource type in your domain.

#### Prefixes
The `prefixes` key contains an object mapping RDF prefixes to a namespace URI.

E.g.
```javascript
  "prefixes": {
    "schema": "http://schema.org/",
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
  }
```

The prefixes can be used to shorten URIs in the resource definitions as explained in the following section.

#### Resource definitions
A example resource definition looks as follows:

```javascript
{
  ...
  "resources": {
    "people": {
      "name": "person",
      "class": "foaf:Person",
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "foaf:name"
        },
        "age": {
          "type": "number",
          "predicate": "foaf:age"
        }
      },
      "relationships": {
        "location": {
          "predicate": "foaf:based_near",
          "target": "location",
          "cardinality": "one"
        },
        "accounts": {
          "predicate": "foaf:account",
          "target": "account",
          "cardinality": "many"
        },
        "publications": {
          "predicate": "foaf:publications",
          "target": "document",
          "cardinality": "many"
        }
      }
      "features": ["include-uri"],
      "new-resource-base": "https://my-application.com/people/"
    }
  }
}
```

We will use this example to explain how various features in mu-cl-resources work.

##### Overview of the keys
Each resource definition is an key/object pair in the top-level `resources` object. The key (e.g. `people`) is used as default for the `name` and `path` properties.

The resource definition object consists of the following keys:
* `name (optional)`: Name of the resource to use when referring to the resource internally in the domain configuration. If not specified, the object's key will be used as name.
* `path (optional)`: Path on which the resource is supplied in the API (e.g. `people`). If not specified, the object's  key will be used as path. This also corresponds to the `type` property in the JSON body.  JSONAPI advises to use the plural form here.
* `class`: Sets the RDF Class to which instances should belong
* `attributes`: Describes the attributes of the resource.
* `relationships`: Describes relationships of the resource.
* `features`: Optional features to be used in this resource. Our example indicates the URI should be returned as an attribute.
* `new-resource-base`: The prefix for the URI used when creating new resources.

##### Attributes
The attributes section in the resource definition corresponds to the attributes in the JSON payload.  This section describes how to define attributes.

The attributes section in our example looks like:

```javascript
      "attributes": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "predicate": "foaf:name"
        },
        "age": {
          "type": "number",
          "predicate": "foaf:age"
        }
      }
```

Each attribute is a key/object pair in the attributes object. The key reflects the name of the attribute (e.g. `age`). The attribute definitions consists of the following properties:
* `type`: Type of the attribute.  This ensures we correctly translate the attribute from JSON to SPARQL and vice-versa.
* `predicate`: RDF property of the attribute.  This is the URL used on the arrow of the RDF model in the triplestore.

A wide set of types is supported.  Extensions are necessary in order to implement new types:

  - *string* A regular string
  - *number* A number. Can be [decimals](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#decimal) or [floats](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#float). For read-only operations more types ([integers](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#integer)) are supported.
  - *integer* An [integer](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#integer), being a non-bounded whole number
  - *float* A [float](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#float), being a floating point number
  - *boolean* A boolean, true or false
  - *date* A date as understood by your triplestore
  - *datetime* A date and time combination, as understood by your triplestore
  - *time* A time without a date, as understood by your triplestore
  - *url* A URL to another resource
  - *uri-set* An array of URIs
  - *string-set* An array of strings
  - *language-string* A string which has a language connected to it (may contain multiple languages)
  - *language-string-set* An array of strings which have a language connected to it (may contain multiple languages per answer)
  - *g-year* Experimental: A specific representation of a year
  - *geometry* Experimental: A geometry-string in a format your triplestore understands

##### Relationships
The relationships section in the resource definition corresponds to the relationships in the JSON payload.  This section describes how to define relationships.

The relationships section in our example looks like:

```javascript
      "relationships": {
        "location": {
          "predicate": "foaf:based_near",
          "target": "location",
          "cardinality": "one"
        },
        "accounts": {
          "predicate": "foaf:account",
          "target": "account",
          "cardinality": "many"
        },
        "publications": {
          "predicate": "foaf:publications",
          "target": "document",
          "cardinality": "many"
        }
      }
```

Each relationship is a key/object pair in the relationships object. The key reflects the name of the relationship (e.g. `publications`). The relationship definitions consists of the following properties:
* `predicate`: URI of the RDF property by which the related objects can be found.
* `target`: Name of the resource to be linked to.
* `cardinality`: Cardinality of the relationship. Must be `"one"` or `"many"`.
* `inverse (optional)`: When set to `true` it inverses the direction of the relationship supplied in `predicate`.

##### Inheritance

Superclasses may be specified as a list after the resource name.  If a person is both an animal as well as an agent, we would write it as such:

```javascript
{
  ...
  "resources": {
    "people": {
      "name": "person",
      "class": "foaf:Person",
      "super": ["animals", "agents"],
      ...
    },
    "animals": { ... },
    "agents": {
      "class": "foaf:Agent",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

A definition of this kind includes instances of type `foaf:Person` when listing animals and when listing agents.  Any attributes or relationships set on `animal` or `agent` will be available on `person`.

Used types may change over time as the SPARQL endpoint evolves.  The following is subject to change.  Creating a new person will currently store both the type `foaf:Person` as well as `foaf:Agent`.  When using `agent` in a relationship, anything that has the type `foaf:Agent` or `foaf:Person` is accepted.  The json-api response will yield the most specific type in the listing (when the `foaf:Person` type is found, a `person` will be added to the listing).


### Querying the API

mu-cl-resources provides extensive support for searching and filtering through results.  A notable exception is fuzzy text search as that is not a built-in for standard SPARQL.

The [JSONAPI spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-filtering) leaves all details on searching, except for the used url parameter, open to the implementors.  Our specification leverages the breath of the Linked Data model to enable powerful searches.

We will mostly base ourselves on the example which was previous supplied.

    (define-resource person ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:Person")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:name")
                           :required)
                    (:age :number ,(s-url "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/age")))
      :has-one `((location :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:based_near")
                           :as "location"))
      :has-many `((account :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:account")
                           :as "accounts")
                  (document :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:publications")
                            :as "publications"))
      :features '(include-uri)
      :resource-base (s-url "https://my-application.com/people/")
      :on-path "people")

    (define-resource account ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:OnlineAccount")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:accountName")))
      :has-one `((person :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:accounts")
                         :inverse t
                         :as "owner"))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/accounts/")
      :on-path "accounts")

Various resources have not been defined in our example.  `location` and `document` are left as an exercise to the reader.

#### Basic filtering

Basic searching is done by using the `?filter` query parameter.  We can search for "John Doe" in any key of our `person` by sending

    GET /people?filter=John Doe

If we want to search only for names matching "John Doe", we can limit the search to that keywoard.

    GET /people?filter[name]=John Doe

All of these searches are case-insensitive, and they search for any field which contain the contents (John Doelala) would therefore be returned too.  We can make an exact match with a special search.

    GET /people?filter[:exact:name]=John Doe

All filter modifiers start with a colon (:) followed by the name of the filter, followed by a configuration parameter.  This specific filter will search for a name with exactly "John Doe" in its contents.  No more, no less.

#### Filtering relationships

Filters can also be scoped to relationships.  JSONAPI guarantees that attributes and relationships will never share a name.  Hence we can use the same syntax as we used to identify an attribute in order to identify a relationship.

    GET /people?filter[account]=GitHub

Searches for people which have an account named Mozilla.  It is also possible to search for specific properties, or to apply special filters to this.  Assuming we want to find all accounts for people whose *name* contains John, we'd search for the following:

    GET /accounts?filter[owner][name]=John

We can add more filters as we please.  We can search for all documents belonging to a person named John who has an account named exactly `Dropbox`.

    GET /documents?filter[document-owner][name]=John&filter[document-owner][account][:exact:name]=Dropbox

This will return all documents belonging to anyone named John in an account named exactly `Dropbox`.

#### Sorting

Sorting is specified in [JSONAPI](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sorting) somewhat more extensively.  What is specified there works, but is augmented to sorting by relationships.

Let's sort our users by their name

    GET /people?sort=name

Let's sort by age, descending and then by name

    GET /people?sort=-age,name

Sorting by relationships allows us to sort accounts by the name of their owner

    GET /accounts?sort=owner.name

Assuming your result set consists of strings, you can sort ignoring case by using the `:no-case:` modifier.  Application in result sets containing a multitude of properties is undefined and implementation may change.

    GET /accounts?sort=-:no-case:name

#### Filtering on exact relationships

Objects in JSONAPI are identified by their type and their identifier.  To find all objects that link to another object through some relationship, we can use this feature.

Imagine we want to find all users who have published a specific paper with ID 42 (the generated identifiers are UUIDs, but for the sake of this example, we'll assume the document has ID 42.

    GET /people?filter[publications][:id:]=42

This pattern becomes more intersting when we start searching for more than one document.  To search for all people that have published one of three papers (ids being 42, 45, 66), we can build a comma-seperated list of these ids.

    GET /people?filter[publications][:id:]=42,45,66

This filter can be combined with the other filters to provide very extensive search interfaces.

#### Special filters

Aside from regular text searches, a set of custom filters have been added.  These filters are the last component of a search, and are easy to identify as they start with a colon (:).  Following is a brief list of filters which exist.  This list may be extended over time.

- *:uri:* Search for the URL of a relationship.

    GET /people?filter[accounts][:uri:]=http://my-application.com/people/42

- *:exact:* Searches for the exact string as a value

    GET /people?filter[accounts][:exact:name]=Dropbox

- *:gt:* Ensures the property has a larger value than the supplied value

    GET /people?filter[:gt:age]=42

- *:gte:* Ensures the property has a value larger than or equal to the supplied value
- *:lt:* Ensures the property has a smaller value than then supplied value
- *:lte:* Ensures the property has a smaller value than then supplied value or is equal to the supplied value

- *:has-no:* Ensures the supplied relationship does not exist.  An example could list all people without an account.  The supplied value is not used.  Syntax may be subject to change.

    GET /people?filter[:has-no:account]=yes

- *:has:* The inverse of `:has-no:` forces the relationship to exist.  Syntax may be subject to change.

#### Including results

There exists an optional part of [the JSONAPI spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes) which handles the inclusion of related resources.  It specifies how you can request resources related to your response so you don't have to make too many calls to the server.

In order to add resources you want to see returned, specify the resources by using the `include` query parameter.  We could request all people with their related publications like so:

    GET /people?include=publications

This can be combined with other specifications.  The previous call returned all people, even if there was no publication.  We can only yield people which have a publication, and yield the publications too.

    GET /people?include=publications&filter[:has:publications]=true

You can also get nested results.  We can list accounts with the related people and the related publications:

    GET /accounts?include=owner.publications

We can also include the location if we'd want to render that too:

    GET /accounts?include=owner.publications,owner.location

Combining included results with filters makes for a very powerful API.  Note that including results does require more queries to be sent to the database.

#### Pagination

Pagination is also included in [the JSONAPI spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination).  All resources have it enabled by default.  We support the `page[number]` and `page[size]` variant.

The default page size can be configured by setting the `*default-page-size*` to the desired amount of pages.  It defaults to 20.  Single resources can opt out of pagination.  Single requests can overwrite the size of the pagination.  In practice, we discover that there's nearly always an upper bound you want to set for the pagination to ensure things don't break in the frontend.  Included resources (using the `include` query parameter) are never paginated.

If you want to override the default page size in your `domain.lisp`, add the following code:

    (defparameter *default-page-size* 50)

You can also choose to set the `MU_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE` environment variable before mu-cl-resources boots.

If you want to opt out of pagination for a specific resource, add the `no-pagination-defaults` feature.

    (define-resource account ()
      :class (s-prefix "foaf:OnlineAccount")
      :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:accountName")))
      :has-one `((person :via ,(s-prefix "foaf:accounts")
                         :inverse t
                         :as "owner"))
      :features '(no-pagination-defaults)
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/accounts/")
      :on-path "accounts")

If you want to override the page size for a specific request, you can do so by suppling the `page[size]` query parameter:

    GET /people?page[size]=100

If you want to request a different page and a different page size, supply both `page[size]` and `page[number]`:

    GET /people?page[size]=42&page[number]=3

If you want mu-cl-resources to yield the total amount of results in the `meta` portion of the response, set `*include-count-in-paginated-responses*` to `t` in your `domain.lisp`.

    (defparameter *include-count-in-paginated-responses* t)


#### Sparse fieldsets

Sparse fieldsets is also [a feature of JSONAPI](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets).  If your model has many attributes, but you do not intend to render them on the frontend, you can opt out of fetching them.  Use the `fields` query parameter to fetch only the necessary results.

The `fields` parameter needs to be scoped to the type of the objects for which you want to limit the returned properties.  If we'd want to return only the name for a people listing, we'd use the following:

    GET /people?fields[people]=name

This becomes more intersting as we include more resources.  Say that I include the publications, but only the title and publication-date of these should be taken into account.

    GET /people?include=publications&fields[people]=name&fields[documents]=publication-date,title

You can add filters to ensure we only get authors of papers aged over 42 which have a Dropbox account:

    GET /people?filter[accounts][:exact:name]=Dropbox&filter[:gt:age]=42&filter[:has:publication]=true&include=publications


### Caching

Efficient caching is a complex story.  mu-cl-resources ships with support for two levels of caching: an internal cache which can keep track of object properties and counts, and an external cache which can cache complete queries.

Both of these caches are subject to change in their implementation, but the end-user API should stay the same.

#### Internal cache

In order to opt in to the internal model caching, set `*cache-model-properties*` to `t`.  Note that this currently assumes mu-cl-resources is the only service altering the resources.

    (defparameter *cache-model-properties* t)

Separate from this, you can choose to also cache the count queries.  On very large datasets, counting the amount of results may become expensive.  Set the `*cache-count-queries*` parameter to `t` for this.

    (defparameter *cache-count-queries* t)

Note: mu-cl-resources does not clear its internal caches when external services update the semantic model without wiring.  See below for wiring the delta-notifier.

#### External cache

Caching requests is more complex for a JSONAPI than for a web page.  A single update may invalidate a wide range of pages, but it should not invalidate too many pages.  As such, we've written a separate cache for JSONAPI-like bodies.  Find it at [mu-semtech/mu-cache](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cache).

In order to enable the external cache, you have to set the `*supply-cache-headers-p*` parameter to `t` in your `domain.lisp`.

    (defparameter *supply-cache-headers-p* t)

Note: mu-cl-resources speaks the protocol of this cache, but does not update the cache when external resources update the semantic model without see below for wiring the delta-notifier.

#### Cache clearing with delta-notifier

mu-cl-resources has multiple levels of caching and can update these when it updates the model in the database.  when external services update the semantic model, mu-cl-resources needs to be informed about these changes so it can correctly clear the caches it maintains.

In order for cache clearing to work, delta's need to be received.  This requires setting up mu-authorization and delta-notifier to receive the delta's.  mu-authorization needs to be configured so it sends raw delta messages to the delta-notifier.  The delta-notifier needs to be configured so it forwards the correct format to mu-cl-resources.  mu-cl-resources needs to be wired to the mu-cache so it can clear those caches when changes arrive.

##### Configuring mu-authorization and wiring to delta-notifier

mu-authorization handles security for most calls in your backend and creates delta messages for all updated triples.  See the [mu-semtech/mu-authorization readme](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-authorization) for information on how to set up this security layer.

The delta-notifier can send messages to various entities to update their internal caches.  See [mu-semtech/delta-notifier readme](https://github.com/mu-semtech/delta-notifier) for more information on how to add the delta-notifier to your stack.


##### Wiring the delta-notifier, mu-cache, and mu-cl-resources

In the following setup we assume a few names.  `resourcebackend` is the name for the mu-cl-resources component, `resourcecache` is the name for the mu-cl-resources cache.  Update the examples so they match your use-case.

All services need to be booted up, and we need to ensure we have the naming right for our further wiring.

Update the `docker-compose.yml` so the wiring contains the following (we only discuss the pieces relevant for our setup):

``` yaml
  services:
    resourcebackend:
      image: semtech/mu-cl-resources:1.20.0
      environment:
        CACHE_CLEAR_PATH: "http://resourcecache/.mu/clear-keys"
    resourcecache:
      image: semtech/mu-cache
      links:
        - resourcebackend:backend
    deltanotifier:
      image: semtech/mu-delta-notifier
      volumes:
          - ./config/delta:/config
```

The delta-notifier has to inform resources about all changes which did not originate from mu-cl-resources.  Version 1.18.0 experts resource format v0.0.1.

Ensure the `./config/delta/rules.js` contains at least the following rule (you can add rules to the top-level array):

``` javascript
  export default [
    {
      match: {
        subject: { }
      },
      callback: {
        url: "http://resourcebackend/.mu/delta",
        method: "POST"
      },
      options: {
        resourceFormat: "v0.0.1",
        gracePeriod: 250,
        ignoreFromSelf: true
      }
    }
  ];
```

To ensure mu-cl-resources sends its updates back to the resourcecache, it needs to have the `CACHE_CLEAR_PATH` environment variable set, as in the example docker-compose.yml above.

``` yaml
  services:
    resourcebackend:
      image: semtech/mu-cl-resources:1.20.0
      environment:
        CACHE_CLEAR_PATH: "http://resourcecache/.mu/clear-keys"
```

## Discussions
### Why this component?
This component is in use in a great deal of mu.semte.ch stacks.  A high-level picture as to why we built this component, and how it fits in the architecture, is suiting.

The idea of mu-cl-resources is to provide an API which can easily be consumed by frontend applications.  The most common calls which a backend offers are repetitive and boring to implement.  Good developers should not be bothered with these boring details.  Instead, a declarative configuration can get rid of all of this.

Furthermore, the wide reuse of this component provides us with a rich shared code-base.  The wide use of the code-base allows us to unlock an enormous amount of shared value by implementing small features in this codebase.  On the flipside, we should take great care that this repository does not get out of hand, as that may impact many applications.

### Is this a microservice?

Much of the code needed to implement this component was written specifically for this component.  It can be argued that this component is therefore not a typical microservice component.  We would argue differently.

From a consumer's perspective, the configuration supplied of mu-cl-resources is the relevant portion of this service.  The API which is offered may be broad, but the configuration to maintain is comparatively small.  As the consumer has a good overview of the code necessary to configure this service, this could be considered a microservice from the consumer's perspective.

From the developer's perspective things may look different.  It is clear that mu-cl-resources quite a broad code base.  Replacing it with other components has proven to be more expensive than expected.  Although this holds, many of the used functions could (and should) be abstracted into separate libraries over time.  Furthermore, we expect a similar code-base to work in different languages, although more code may need to be written.

### Future of inheritance
Inheritance comes into play for two cases: one is yielding a polymorphic API, another is coping with inheritance in the datamodel.  The current implementation may change over time but these cases should work with or without some workarounds.

#### A polymorphic API

A polymorphic API uses the types emitted by mu-cl-resources.  These may overlap exactly with the types in the triplestore but they could diverge.  You might have an API in which you can "score" an item with a score instance.  The scored item doesn't necessarily have a separate class in the triplestore but inheritance in an API should be able to cope with this.  An ideal speciifcation could look like the following:

    (define-resource score ()
      :class (s-prefix "ext:Score")
      :properties `((:motivation :string ,(s-prefix "ext:motivation"))
                    (:value :number ,(s-prefix "ext:value")))
      :has-one ((scorable :via ,(s-prefix "ext:hasScore")
                          :inverse t
                          :as "scorable"))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/scores/")
      :on-path "scores")

    (define-resource scorable ()
       :has-one ((score :via ,(sprefix "ext:hasScore")
                        :as "score"))
       :on-path "scorables")

    (define-resource test (scorable)
      :class (s-prefix "ext:Test")
      :properties `((:content :string ,(s-prefix "ext:submissionText")))
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/tests/")
      :on-path "scores")

    (define-resource car (scorable)
      :class (s-prefix "ext:Car")
      :properties `()
      :resource-base (s-url "http://my-application.com/cars/")
      :on-path "cars")

When fetching scores, the scorable property may have resources from both the `ext:Test` as well as from the `ext:Car` types.  Both will be returned through the API.  Fetching `/scorables` would have a similar effect, there are no items of type `scorable`, only of its subtypes.

#### Datamodel inheritance

The glue layer has inheritance, but the data model may have that too.  Because we currently don't reason on types in the triplestore, inheritance must be handled by components that desire to use it.  This may lead to strange situations as the ideal solution is for the triplestore to handle such use.

In order to experiment with inheritance, mu-cl-resources takes an accepting approach.  Whenever we fetch data, we verify if any of the matching types exist and we assume the most specific type is the one to use.  Whenever we store data we write out all types.  That should make it easier for other services to cope with inheritance without knowing too much about it by themselves.  A reasoner in the triplestore would clearly be an upgrade to this.  Should that arrive, mu-cl-resources may choose not to write out nor to query all types.  At that point, this would not cause a behavioural change to the system as a whole.


### Features to be documented

#### Authorization

The current implementation of mu-cl-resources ships with an extensive authorization model.  This model is being revized as we aim to cut authorization out of the microservices and convert it into a layer on top of the SPARQL endpoint.  Thereby abstracting authorization and ensuring it is configured correctly throughout the whole stack.

Current configuration follows a model which has a grant token on a per-object basis.  The following query builds the connection to the token.

    (format nil (s+ "~A session:account/^foaf:account/((a/auth:belongsToActorGroup*/auth:hasRight)|(auth:belongsToActorGroup*/auth:hasRight)) ~A. ~&"
                    "~A auth:hasToken ~A. ~&"
                    "~A auth:operatesOn/(~:[~;(^auth:belongsToArtifactGroup*/^a)|~](^auth:belongsToArtifactGroup*)) ~A. ")
            (session-uri) token-var
            token-var token
            token-var allow-target-inheritance source)

We do not document this in depth as support for this is only useful at this time.

#### Using different sparql stores

The default connector assumes you'll connect to a Virtuoso endpoint.  However, this is not a requirement.  By adding the necessary content into the dependencies folder, you can choose to enable a different store.  This may mock specific details of the store, such as wrapping incorrect results or choosing a different connector point.  An example of this can be found at [madnificent/cl-fuseki-blazegraph-plugin](https://github.com/madnificent/cl-fuseki-blazegraph-plugin)

#### Generators

There are a few applications which build on top of mu-cl-resources to generate meaningful content.

One example is the mu-application-generator which scaffolds an resource editing application based on your API, another is [mu-semtech/cl-resources-openapi-generator](https://github.com/mu-semtech/cl-resources-openapi-generator).

#### Configuration parameters

There are a wider set of configuration parameters which allow you to configure mu-cl-resources to your liking.  Including enabling experimental features.  Many of these are currently not documented, most can be found in the release notes.  Following is a set of the configuration options.

You con configure an option by calling `(setf property-name value)` after the `in-package` statement of your domain.lisp.  Eg:

    (in-package :mu-cl-resources)

    (setf *verify-content-type-header* nil)
    (setf *verify-accept-header* nil)


##### Content and accept types

The content-type and accept type should be validated as per jsonapi.org specification.  Due to historic reasons, the ACCEPT type is not checked by default, whereas the CONTENT-TYPE is checked on update/create requests.  Following parameters allow for configuration.

- *`*verify-accept-header*`* _[default: nil]_ Validation on the ACCEPT header to contain application/vndi+json.
- *`*verify-content-type-header*`* _[default: t]_ Validation on the CONTENT-TYPE header to contain application/vndi+json.

##### Logging

mu-cl-resources can log queries and delta messages which should be cleared by the cache.

###### Queries

mu-cl-resources logs all queries by default.  You can configure which queries should be logged by setting the `sparql:*query-log-types*` provided by the cl-fuseki library.  The parameter should be an array with (some of) the following keywords or `nil` for no logging.

- *`:update`* Logging of update queries
- *`:query`* Logging of retrieval queries
- *`:ask`* Logging of queries indicated to be ASK queries explicitly
- *`:update-group`* Logging of queries in case update queries are requested to be executed in a postpone fashion (see cl-fuseki)
- *`:default`* Logging of queries which are not explicitly typed (could be any of the above)

An example configuration to only log known update queries and known ask queries would be:

    `(defparameter sparql:*query-log-types* '(:update :ask))`

###### Delta-based cache clearing

The cache of the delta service can be cleared by wiring the delta-notifier to mu-cl-resources.  mu-cl-resources will only clear the me-cache if cache-keys are being sent.  The clear-keys which mu-cl-resources sends to the mu-cache on delta messages can be configured by setting the `*log-delta-clear-keys*` to a non-nil value.

     (setf *log-delta-clear-keys* t)


##### Query optimization

Queries can become complex.  You can request a known triple to be added to queries which only contain OPTIONAL elements.  This may make the queries a bit lighter to execute.  Support for this is not fully implemented and might be removed if deemed unnecessary.

    (setf *include-at-least-one-non-optional* t)

The maximum amount of OPTIONAL clauses used in queries select queries used to fill in partial properties of an item, can be limited using `*max-optionals-per-query*`.  If this is non-nil, it must be a whole number greater than 0.

    (setf *max-optionals-per-query* 8)

##### Pagination

Pagination is described separately above.  Not that included resources are never paginated.  Both the default page size, as well as the amount of available results can be returned.

- *`*default-page-size*`* _[default: 20]_ Sets the default page size.
- *`*include-count-in-paginated-responses*`* _[default: nil]_ Adds the amount of available results in the meta object of the response.

##### Caching

See the separate section on caching.  Following properties can be configured:

- *`*supply-cache-headers-p*`* _[default: nil]_ Supply cache-headers in responses for the mu-cache if set to t.
- *`*cache-model-properties-p*`* _[default: nil]_ Cache model properties internally for all models if set to t.
- *`*cache-count-queries-p*` * _[default: nil]_ Cache result of count queries internally if set to t.
- *`*cache-clear-path*`* _[default: nil]_ If set and deltas are received, cache clear keys will be sent to this endpoint.

#### Separate domain.lisp files

The domain.lisp file exists in multiple formats.  As such, experimental drafts in json also exist.  It is also possible to split your domain.lisp file in multiple files and ensure they're all loaded.  In order to load a second file, you could use `read-domain-file` in your domain.lisp.  It understands lisp files and json files.

    (read-domain-file "my-main-domain.lisp")
    (read-domain-file "my-other-domain.lisp")
